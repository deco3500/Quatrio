##Implementation##
Features a discussion board similar to reddit with specific boards for each topic. Each board will feature a collasion of new facts pooled from multiple sources.
Users will be able to comment/start a discussion on each different article and other users are able to upvote or down vote a comment. 
Users also gain points for making comments that are highly upvoted.
The site will also feature live debates that users can sign up for and debate about the topic of the week. The debates will feature a moderator to limit spam.
