##Introduction##
Versi is a mobile-based web page/app which addresses the issue of bias in controversial topics in the media. It is primarily a discussion/debate forum where users are able to somewhat freely express their opinions but in a more professional manner. Bias in the media often leads to misinformation of major news topics, which may generally spark a massive division in society.

================================
##Concept##
News is information that should be represented purely with straight facts to provide education to the reader, but with many different news outlets with many different opinionated writers and journalists, sometimes articles may appear biased towards or against a certain person or group represented in an article. When a person reads an article that has any sort of basis in opinion, if facts are skewed or misinterpreted, they may form an opinion based on the writer's opinion rather than pure fact and truth. Versi aims to combat this issue in journalism by creating an online platform that collates articles of the same topic or issue from different sources within human rights and education. This platform users to spot bias in articles and construct and then convey their own opinion about the various subjects. This is aimed at young adults around the ages of 18-30 as they are generally most interested and opinionated age group in topics such as this.

Decisions will be made by the project manager, but ultimately the whole group must also agree to it before making any major decisions which could potentially make drastic changes to the project. Logistics are not of major importance for this particular project; transport and equipment is not required (individual possessions/resources excepted i.e. laptop), and each team member is individually responsible for attending and participating in group meetings. If a member is unable to attend a meeting, he/she must let fellow members of the team know preferably a day in advance, unless sudden personal commitments must be fulfilled.

Poor performance of any team members must be resolved through communication, if that alone is not enough to resolve and come to an agreement within the group, only then may it be taken to discuss further with the tutors. If in any case conflicts exist whether regarding the project or between group members, the project manager may be able to step in to help decide upon what should be done to solve the problem depending on the what the conflict is.

==============================================
##Communications##
Outside of the workshop hours that this course has provided us with to meet up, Quatrio will be meeting at UQ on Thursdays 12-2pm most likely around GP South. We have decided that our primary communication will be made through Facebook; the group page and a group conversation in Messenger, as Facebook seems to have been something we have all adapted into our everyday lives. As for the files and documents, they have been created through Google Drive so that editing will be easy for everyone to access and collaborate at any one time. The file name conventions has not been particularly set to anything uniform, however when submitting possibly “DECO3500Quatrio_docname.filetype”.

##Plan##
###Project Phases###
* Research - Jessalyn, Ashleigh, Sarah and Zach
  * Research current online forums and how they are structured i.e. how the forums are moderated
  * Research voting systems i.e. upvoting and downvoting, vs assigning frequent users badges. Figure out how these different voting systems boost user moral and find out which ones encourage users to keep using a website
  * Research ways to host live debates and how to maintain fairness in debates. Look into online debate hosting web sites and find out how they structure their debating sessions and decide what structure works best for Versi. Additionally, research debate moderation methods
  * Research aggregators and web search APIs to use to gather data from various news articles with similar to the same topic
* Requirements
  * Ensure the website is accessible on a mobile platform whether through an app or web page (mobile-friendly)
  * Ensure the mobile version of the site is fully functional i.e. can host debates without crashing, aggregate and display facts and can support multiple users
  * Design must be consistent on both website and mobile platform
  * Opinions/debates should be discussed in a professional manner
* Design
  * Use marvel and illustrator to construct sketches and prototypes of the interface
  * Interface designs must show clear navigations around, in order for it to be user friendly
* Construction
  * The project will be built using PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and MySQL
* Testing
  * Testing will occur after the build phase is complete. It will consist of both unit/code testing and user testing
* Milestones 
  * The project will be split into 3 main sprints
   * The first and current sprint is the research and design sprint where all research tasks and prototype designs of the project will take place 
   * The second and largest sprint is the build phase. This cycle is where the design will be implemented. All team members are required to participate in the build phase
   * The third phase is the testing phase where the product will undergo immense testing. All bugs, errors and user complaints will be fixed as well in this phase
